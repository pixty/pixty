    Your privacy is important to us. At PIXTY, we are committed to protecting your personal information with the highest level of integrity. This policy is intended to inform you of our privacy practices in association with the collection and use of your information obtained through our website (pixty.io), services, and applications. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and subject to the Terms of Service as well as our other security policies. The following comprises the terms of our policy:

Personal Information:

We do not collect any personal information from visitors of our website. However, if you use and/or purchase our services or applications, there may be some information we collect. When we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you, we will explicitly ask you for it. For example, to use the PIXTY API service, we may collect, store, and access one or more of the following: (1) an email address; (2) photos or video that you upload through the application or otherwise provide to us; and (3) a biometric template, comprised of a list of numbers created by us from the photos or videos you uploaded. In addition we will store any information you provide to our sales department within one of our contact forms.

The personal information we collect from you will be used to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. In support of these uses, we may also use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, and to improve our products or services. We may also use your email address to contact you regarding administrative notices from time to time. Information that is collected by or sent to us may be stored and processed in the United States, Canada, or any other country in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using any of our products or services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

We may use demographic information collected from you during the registration or purchase process (including age, location and gender data) or aggregate information from all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in the form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.

When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain other information about you. This includes the URL that you just came from, the URL you next go to, the browser you are using, your IP address, the pages you visit, and the types of services you purchase.

Anonymous Video Analytics:

Our Crowd Analytics SDK and IMRSV product offering uses Anonymous Video Analytics (AVA). AVA analyzes millions of pixels per second and anonymously detects general traits of viewers, along with demographic and engagement data from multiple people simultaneously. AVA has no ability to recognize or identify anyone. The software gathers purely numerical data, no personally identifiable information is collected and no images are ever saved, recorded or transmitted. The anonymized data is aggregated by the software to report numerical statistics. The analytics generated by AVA software provides marketers and businesses valuable insights into what’s actually happening within the proximity of displays and other product locations in real time.

Anonymous Information collected may include:

Total count of individuals
Demographic data such as gender and approximate age
Engagement data such as attention, duration time and number of glances
Viewer attributes such as estimated distance and general position
Emotional expression (Facial Coding)

Media Data Policy:

PIXTY customers submit images and videos to our our API services.

PIXTY' Emotion Analysis API processes submitted videos from each of our customers to provide facial coding analysis on faces identified in the video. Original videos are not stored on our system.

PIXTY' Face Recognition API processes submitted videos from each of our customers to provide facial coding analysis on faces identified in the video. Original videos are not stored on our system.


Disclosure of Information:

Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent.

We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. In addition, we must (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to address or resolve inquiries or problems, or comply with court orders, information requests from government agencies, or other legal or regulatory actions.

This Privacy Policy applies if you are a visitor to the PIXTY Site or if you purchase the Services. If you use a third party application or service that is integrated with PIXTY, then such third party's privacy policy will govern the use, storage and disclosure of your data in connection with such application or service. PIXTY may receive orders, subpoenas or other legal demands for Personally Identifiable Data that has been collected on behalf of such third party providers through the use of their applications or services. In such cases, PIXTY refers the party requesting the Personally Identifiable Data to the applicable third party provider. That provider will respond in accordance with its own policies and may disclose your Personally Identifiable Data in response to such subpoena or other demand for information. Please remember that PIXTY is not responsible for the policies and practices of such third party providers. If you have questions about any such disclosures, you should contact the applicable provider directly. PIXTY will have no liability in connection with any act or omission of any such provider with respect to your data or information or otherwise.

Security of your Information:

We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please know that due to the existing legal and technical environment, we cannot guarantee that any personal information we obtain will not be disclosed to third parties in ways not described in this policy.

PIXTY takes reasonable precautions such as policy-based access control to protect Data in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. PIXTY follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Data, both during transmission and once received by PIXTY. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While PIXTY strives to protect your Data, PIXTY does not guarantee its security.

Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties:

PIXTY does not share or disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information, except as described in this section.

Agents, consultants and related third parties: PIXTY uses third party vendors to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include data storage services, database maintenance services and payment processing. When PIXTY employs such third party vendors to perform services on its behalf, PIXTY will only provide them with the Personally Identifiable Information that they need to perform their specific function. Each third party vendor is required to keep such Personally Identifiable Information confidential and not to use such Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing services to PIXTY.
Affiliates: PIXTY may share Personally Identifiable Information with entities that control, are controlled by or under common control with PIXTY (each, an "Affiliate") for the purpose of assisting PIXTY in providing its Services to you. In that event, any such Affiliate will use Personally Identifiable Information solely as permitted under this Privacy Policy.
Business transfers: PIXTY reserves the right to sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personally Identifiable Information may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer or successor of PIXTY may continue to use your Personally Identifiable Information as set forth in this policy.
Legal requirements and other circumstances: PIXTY may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required by law or if it believes in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PIXTY, or (c) to protect the property or safety of users of the PIXTY Site or Services or any third party. If PIXTY is required by law to disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information, then we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of that disclosure requirement, unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order. In addition, if PIXTY does not believe the disclosure request has been properly issued, then PIXTY will object to such request.

Children’s Privacy:

Although the website is a general audience site, children under 13 are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can only use this service in conjunction with your parent or guardian.

Changes to this Privacy Policy:

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, should we deem it advisable to do so. If we do change the Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version with a new “updated” date. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
